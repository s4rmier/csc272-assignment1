Classes and objects are fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP), including languages like Java. A class serves as a blueprint or template, defining the structure and behavior for a specific type of object. It encapsulates both data (in the form of attributes or fields) and methods (functions that operate on that data) into a cohesive unit. Classes act as abstract representations, outlining the properties and capabilities that objects of that type will possess. They provide a way to organize code, promote reusability, and model real-world entities or concepts in programming. As Booch et al. (2007) explain, "A class is a set of objects that share a common structure and a common behavior" (p. 103). Classes can also implement inheritance, allowing for the creation of hierarchies and the sharing of common attributes and behaviors among related types. This hierarchical structure enables developers to create more specialized classes from general ones, promoting code reuse and logical organization. Additionally, classes can implement interfaces, which define a contract of methods that the class must provide, further enhancing flexibility and polymorphism in the code. The design of classes is crucial in OOP, as it sets the foundation for the entire program structure and can significantly impact maintainability, scalability, and overall code quality.

Objects, in contrast, are concrete instances of classes. When you create an object, you're instantiating a specific occurrence of the class, allocating memory to store its individual state. Each object has its own unique set of attribute values, even if multiple objects are created from the same class. Objects interact with each other and with the program, carrying out the actual work defined by their class methods. They encapsulate their internal state, often providing controlled access through methods, which helps maintain data integrity and implement the principle of information hiding. This separation between the abstract definition (class) and concrete instances (objects) allows for flexible and modular program design. It enables polymorphism, where objects of different classes can be treated uniformly if they share a common interface or base class. Booch et al. (2007) further note that "an object has state, behavior, and identity" (p. 105). The state represents the data stored in the object, behavior refers to how the object acts and reacts to method calls, and identity distinguishes one object from another. Objects can also have relationships with other objects, such as composition (where one object contains another) or association (where objects are related but exist independently). These relationships allow for the creation of complex systems that model real-world scenarios. The lifecycle of objects, including their creation, use, and destruction, is managed by the program and often by the language's runtime environment, which handles memory allocation and garbage collection.

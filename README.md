Objects and classes are fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP). A class is a blueprint or template that defines the structure and behavior of objects, while an object is a concrete instance of a class (Deitel & Deitel, 2020). Classes encapsulate data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data. They provide a way to organize code into reusable and modular units, promoting better code structure and maintainability. When defining a class, programmers specify the attributes and methods that all objects of that class will have, essentially creating a custom data type.

Objects, on the other hand, are specific instances of a class that exist in a program's memory during runtime. They have their own unique set of attribute values and can invoke the methods defined in their class. Multiple objects can be created from the same class, each with its own distinct state but sharing the same structure and behavior defined by the class (Deitel & Deitel, 2020). Objects interact with each other through method calls and can be passed as arguments to functions, returned from functions, and stored in data structures. This ability to create and manipulate objects allows for more intuitive modeling of real-world entities and processes in code, making OOP a powerful paradigm for software development.
